            Yippee, through the funding of your political party, you managed to create a SUPER PAC. Unfortunately, you will have to compete with other PACs to gain influence and bankrupt them </br>

            <p style = "font-weight: bold;">also playable on mobile!</p>

            </br > Basically

            <ol>
                <li>Player 1 is Clinton, Player 2 is Bush, Player 3 is Obama, Player 4 is Trump</li>
                <li>Buy seats in the house of representatives</li>
                <li>Use pork-barrel spending to buy utilities</li>
                <li>Collect donations from your competitors when they land on your districts</li>
                <li>Find information about spaces by putting your mouse over them(if it only shows a cost, then that space is unowned)</li>
                <li>The fee for landing on a utility is the number on the dice times the multiplier(10 if both utilities are owned by the same person, 4 otherwise)</li>
                <li>You might be sent to federal prison for illegal campaign finance methods, but you get pardoned if you roll doubles</li>
                <li>If you land on chance or community chest, the SCOTUS moves you a random number of spaces</li>
                <li>Upgrade your representatives to raise more money</li>
                <li>You get $200 for landing on or passing go</li>
                <li>Franking privilege(free parking)/Amtrak(railroad) don't do anything unfortunately</li>
                <li>If you run out of money you lose</li>
                <li>Any bugs represent problems with the government</li>
            </ol>
